# Summarization of existing text

The prompts in this folder are intended to get GPT-3 to generate multi-paragraph subsections of text from previously generated summaries that usefully compresses the ideas contained within the text. GPT-3 will eventually need to be prompted to follow the author's style, be aware of where it is within the hierarchical outline, and be given good examples of previous expansions, all within 2048 BPEs, with the goal of re-expanding the summary into new text that conveys nearly the same information and fits, as well as possible, within the larger work.
